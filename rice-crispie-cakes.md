# Rice Crispie Cakes

## Ingredients

- Butter (250g)
- Toffees (400g, two bags, individually wrapped)
- Marshmallows (400g, two bags)
- Rice crispies (400g, whole packet)
- Milk chocolate (600g, three bars)

## Steps

1. Unwrap Toffees
1. Melt butter in a _very_ large pan
1. Add toffees to pan and stir occasionally until melted
1. Add marshmallows to pan and stir more often until melted
1. Add Rice crispies and mix until all coated
1. Pour into large tray and smooth down the surface, but don't compact it too much.
1. Fridge for 2h or leave to cool
1. Melt chocolate, and spoon it on top.  Jiggle tray to smooth the chocolate.

## Notes

Shrinkflation seems to apply to everything except butter and marshmallows.  Bags of toffees (200g→175g), rice cripies (400→375g) and chocolate (200g→180g).  Maybe adjust, but I don't bother.

Unwrapping the toffees is a faff, but I can't find non-individually wrapped toffee anywhere.
